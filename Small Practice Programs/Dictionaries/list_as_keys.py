# In Python, a dictionary can only hold a single value for 
# a given key. To workaround this, our single value can be 
# a list containing multiple values. Here we have a 
# dictionary called "wardrobe" with items of clothing and 
# their colors. Fill in the blanks to print a line for each 
# item of clothing with each color, for example: "red shirt", 
# "blue shirt", and so on.

wardrobe = {"shirt":["red","blue","white"], "jeans":["blue","black"]}
for clothing, color in wardrobe:
	for specificColor in color:
		print("{} {}".format(clothing,specificColor))
