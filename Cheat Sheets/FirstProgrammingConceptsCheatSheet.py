# Arithmetic operators
# Python can operate with numbers using the usual mathematical operators, and some special operators,
# too. These are all of them:

""" a + b """ # Adds a and b
""" a - b """ # Subtracts b from a
""" a * b """ # Multiplies a and b
""" a / b """   # Divides a by b
""" a ** b """   # Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a)
""" a // b """  # The integer part of the integer division of a by b
""" a % b """  # The remainder part of the integer division of a by b
