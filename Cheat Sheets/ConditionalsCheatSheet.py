# Comparison operators

""" a == b """ #:a is equal to b
""" a != b """ #:a is different than b
""" a < b """ #:a is smaller than b
""" a <= b """ #:a is smaller or equal to b
""" a > b """ #:a is bigger than b
""" a >= b """ #:a is bigger or equal to b

# Logical operators

""" a and b """ #True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
""" a or b """ #True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
""" not a """ #True if a is False, False if a is True.

#Branching blocks

#In Python, we branch our code using if, else and elif. This is the branching syntax:
""" if condition1:
		if-block
	elif condition2:
		elif-block
	else:
		else-block """
